## Overview

This is a calculator that calculates the total bill based on how much you choose to tip.
It divides the bill and tip evenly between the number of people paying.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

My first objective was just getting the website to work intially.

Once I confirmed that it was functioning properly and the calculations were correct I began to style my website to match the given images as closely as possible while remaining efficient with time.

Once the styling was done I began testing for bugs. After the bugs were repaired I started
refactoring my code so it would be easier to read and more efficient.

### Built with

-   HTML5 markup
-   SCSS Variables and Mixins
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Javascript

### What I learned

I was very thankful to be aware of SCSS for this project due to a lot of the complexity and
repetive code that was able to be eliminated. I was super stoked when I realized for my
Bill and People inputs I could use a Mixin so the code could be written once and applied
to both elements.

```scss
@mixin bill-people-inputs {
    label {
        font-size: 16px;
        margin-bottom: 6px;
        grid-row: 1;
    }
    span {
        font-size: 16px;
        margin-bottom: 6px;
        text-align: end;
        grid-row: 1;

        &.active {
            color: $burntorange;
        }
        &.inactive {
            color: $white;
        }
    }
    input {
        background-color: $verylightgrayishcyan;
        color: $verydarkcyan;
        grid-column: 1 / 3;
        grid-row: 2;
        font-size: 24px;
        padding: 6px 12px;
        border-radius: 4px;
        border: none;
        text-align: end;
        min-width: 0px;
        min-height: 0px;
        &.active {
            cursor: pointer;
            background-color: $verylightpink;
            outline: auto;
            outline-style: solid;
            outline-color: $burntorange;
            caret-color: $burntorange;
        }
        &.inactive {
            outline: none;
            caret-color: $strongcyan;
            @media (hover: hover) {
                &:hover {
                    outline: auto;
                    outline-style: solid;
                    outline-color: $strongcyan;
                    cursor: pointer;
                }
            }
        }
        &::placeholder {
            color: $lightgrayishcyan;
        }
    }
    img {
        grid-row: 2;
        grid-column: 1;
        height: 45%;
        padding-left: 8px;
        @include desktop {
            padding-left: 12px;
        }
    }
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
    console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
